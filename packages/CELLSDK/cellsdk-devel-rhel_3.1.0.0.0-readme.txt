     charge, provided via an IBM developerWorks Web forum on-line
     support. The IBM developerWorks discussion forums let you ask
     questions, share knowledge, ideas, and opinions about technologies
     and programming techniques with other developerWorks users. Use the
     forum content at your own risk. While IBM will attempt to provide a
     timely response to all postings, the use of this developerWorks
     forum does not guarantee a response to every question that is
     posted, nor do we validate the answers or the code that are
     offered.


======================================================================
Installation information

1. Creating a Fedora 9 system image

     Creating a Fedora 9 system image for use with an IBM BladeCenter
     QS21 or QS22 might require additional steps, because some PowerPC
     architecture systems will not handle the size of the default Fedora 9
     ppc64.img netboot image. IBM BladeCenter JS2X series servers
     which use the tg3 network driver might not function correctly due
     to a malfunctioning driver included with Fedora.

     The http://www.bsc.es Web site provides updated versions of the
     ppc64.img netboot image and tg3 network driver to make installation
     easier. Obtain these versions and follow the instructions below to
     create a Fedora 9 system image.

     a. Obtaining Updated Fedora 9 Files

          Download updated files from the following location:

          http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/cellsimulator/sdk3.1/fedora_patches

          Installation of the Fedora 9 operating system requires the
          updated network kernel driver module, tg3.ko. Download this
          file from:

          http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/cellsimulator/sdk3.1/fedora_patches/tg3.ko

          Network installation of the Fedora 9 operating system requires
          the updated ppc64.img netboot image. Download this file from:

          http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/cellsimulator/sdk3.1/fedora_patches/ppc64.img

     b. Fedora 9 DVD installation

          During installation of Fedora 9 from DVD media, do not perform
          the network configuration step until after the installation
          completes and the updated network kernel module is installed. 
          To install Fedora 9 from DVD, follow these steps:

          1. Download the updated tg3.ko kernel module from:

          http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/cellsimulator/sdk3.1/fedora_patches/tg3.ko

          2. Copy the downloaded tg3.ko file onto a USB flash drive.

          3. Boot from the DVD by typing the following command at the
          yaboot prompt:

          > linux vnc 

          4. During the installation of Fedora 9, do not configure the
          network at the network configuration screen.

          5. When the installation finishes, DO NOT reboot the
          BladeCenter. Instead, follow the following procedure to
          install an updated network driver.

               a. Allow the target BladeCenter to access to the USB port
               on the BladeCenter chassis.

               b. Insert the USB flash drive that contains the updated
               tg3.ko driver.

               c. Determine the device name of the USB flash drive, for
               example by examining the output of "dmesg". In the next
               step it is assumed that the device name is "/dev/sdb1".

               d. Mount the flash drive and copy the tg3.ko file to the
               kernel drivers directory by typing the following commands
               at the console prompt:

               # mount /dev/sdb1 /tmp
               # cp /tmp/tg3.ko /mnt/sysimage/lib/modules/2.6.25-14.fc9.ppc64/kernel/drivers/net/

               e. Finish the installation by allowing the BladeCenter to
               reboot.

          6. After the BladeCenter reboots, use the Fedora console tools
          to configure the system for your network.

     c. Installing Fedora 9 using netboot

          If you want to install Fedora 9 onto a PowerPC architecture
          BladeCenter using netboot, you must use an updated ppc64.img
          netboot image and you must update the tg3.ko network kernel
          driver module. To install Fedora 9 using netboot, follow these
          steps:

               1. Download the updated ppc64.img from:

               http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/cellsimulator/sdk3.1/fedora_patches/ppc64.img

               2. Copy the updated ppc64.img to the TFTP server and boot
               the target BladeCenter to the Open Firmware (OF) boot prompt.

               3. Change the base address by typing the following
               commands at the OF prompt:

               > setenv real-base 2000000
               > reset-all

               4. After the BladeCenter returns to the OF prompt, type
               the following command to start a VNC based installation:

               > boot net vnc

               5. Use a vncviewer application to connect to the
               BladeCenter. Next, install Fedora 9 as usual.

               6. When the installation finishes, do not proceed to the
               next step and do not reboot the BladeCenter.

               7. Replace the installed tg3 kernel module with the
               updated tg3 module. To do so, switch to a console prompt
               and type the following commands as the root user:

               # cd /mnt/sysimage/lib/modules/2.6.25-14.fc9.ppc64/kernel/drivers/net/
               # rm tg3.ko
               # zcat /lib/modules/2.6.25-14.fc9.ppc64/kernel/drivers/net/tg3.ko.gz > tg3.ko

               8. Reboot the BladeCenter. Wait for the OF command prompt
               to appear, then proceed to the next step.

               9. Type the following commands at the OF command prompt:

               > setenv real-base C00000
               > reset-all

               10. The firmware will reset. Next, boot the BladeCenter
               from the hard disk.

2. Kernel installation on Fedora 9

     During the installation of the Fedora 9 operating system on
     BladeCenter hardware, stop at the step before you install the SDK
     kernel. Rename /etc/yaboot.conf to /etc/yaboot.conf.orig before
     installing the SDK kernel.

3. The IBM Full-System Simulator

     The IBM Full-System Simulator has been removed from the SDK package,
     and is now available separately. To obtain the Simulator, download
     it from the following alphaWorks Web site:

     http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/cellsystemsim

4. Upgrading from SDK 3.0 on Red Hat(R) Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.1

     SDK 3.1 requires RHEL 5.2. If you are upgrading an SDK 3.0 system
     which is currently running on RHEL 5.1, you must upgrade to RHEL
     5.2 before upgrading the SDK to version 3.1.

5. Building the RHEL 5.2 sysroot

     To cross compile applications on RHEL 5.2, you must build and
     install the compiler sysroot, as these packages cannot be provided
     with the SDK. Follow the instructions contained in the SDK
     Installation Guide v3.1 in the topic, "Installing the IBM
     Full-System Simulator (RHEL 5.2 only)."


======================================================================
Application issues

1. Application lockups

     It is possible to cause an application lockup when executing two or
     more applications each using 9 or more SPEs. You can halt the
     application by typing a "Ctrl-C." In this scenario the 16 physical
     SPEs on an IBM BladeCenter QS22 are over-committed, which can cause
     a problem. The workaround is to ensure that the SPEs are not
     over-committed when executing one or more or applications.

     The RHEL 5.2 kernel provides support for preemptive SPE scheduling. 
     However, under heavy load the underlying SPE context switch code
     does not work correctly in all circumstances. Since SPE context
     switches are very costly in general, it is also advisable from a
     performance perspective to avoid over-commit scenarios.

2. Missing development libraries

     Cross compilation on X86 and X86_64 machines uses the sysroot to
     create CBEA target binaries. Compilation will fail if your code
     needs a development package not already provided in the sysroot. If
     this occurs, an error about a missing header file or library will
     be printed.

     To install the missing package into the sysroot, type the following
     command:

     # rpm -ivh --force --nodeps --noscripts --ignorearch \
       --root=/opt/cell/sysroot <RPM>

     where <RPM> is the RPM file (or files) that provide(s) the development
     libraries.

     Note: The architecture for the RPMs installed into the sysroot must
     be ppc, ppc64, noarch or src (not i386, i686 or x86_64).

3. Diskless rsync network performance on BladeCenter QS21 and QS22

     The IBM BladeCenter QS21 and QS22 do not contain local hard-drives. 
     When using rsync to copy real time data across network, understand
     rsync performance limitations in case of network failure. In an
     event of a network disruption, the client will notice a longer
     delay and receive notification of a connection failure due to the
     rsync protocol and Linux network connection setting parameters. 
     This delay and latency can be optimized on your operating system by
     changing environment variables and user requirements. Refer to the
     networking documentation included with your Linux operating system
     for additional information.

4. 32-bit Eclipse on 64-bit Fedora 9

     32-bit Eclipse will not run on the 64-bit Fedora 9 operating system
     without additional configuration. Follow this procedure to enable
     Eclipse to run:
 
          a. Install cellide using the instructions provided in the
          SDK v3.1 Installation Guide.

          b. Install the 32-bit version of libcairo:

          # yum install libcairo.i386

          c. Install the 32-bit version of libXtst:

          # yum install libXtst.i386

     To start Eclipse, add "-vm" to the Eclipse command line, as
     follows:

     $ /opt/cell/ide/eclipse/eclipse -vm /opt/ibm/java2-i386-50/jre/bin/

5. Building the oprofile source RPM (SRPM) for Fedora 9

     The oprofile source package (oprofile-0.9.3-5bsc.src.rpm) does not
     build on a F9 system due to a change in the compiler. As a
     workaround, you can build the SRPM on a Fedora 7 system, then copy
     the resultant RPM to a Fedora 9 system and install it there, where
     it will function correctly.

6. Applications that use all 16 SPEs might hang on RHEL 5.2

     An application might hang if it uses all 16 SPEs and switches
     frequently between SPEs on RHEL 5.2. To work around this problem,
     modify your application to use less than 16 SPEs.

7. BLAS_NUMSPES restriction

     The DGER/SGER and DGEMM/SGEMM functions in the BLAS library might
     fail with a bus error when using a specific number of SPEs. The
     double precision functions DGER/SGEMM might have a bus error when
     BLAS_NUMSPES is set to 6. The single precision functions SGER/SGEMM
     might have a bus error when BLAS_NUMSPES is set to 3, 6 or 7. To
     work around this issue, do not set BLAS_NUMSPES to a number that
     fails.

8. The crash-spu-commands-1.0-3 package contains an outdated crash
   program

     The crash-spu-commands-1.0-3.ppc.rpm package on the BSC Web site
     contains an outdated crash program binary which does not function
     correctly. Use the new crash binary provided by the
     crash-4.0-7.2.src.rpm package, available from the
     http://people.redhat.com/anderson/ Web site.

     Follow this procedure to replace the crash binary on your system:

     a. Download the updated crash RPM by typing this command:

     $ wget http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash-4.0-7.2.src.rpm

     b. Rebuild the crash binary. This step might be time consuming. 
     Type the following command as the user root:

     # rpmbuild --rebuild crash-4.0-7.2.src.rpm

     c. Install the new crash binary. The "--force" option overrides any
     conflicts with the crash-spu-commands package. Type the following
     command as the user root:

     # rpm -ivh --force /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/ppc64/crash-4.0-7.2.ppc64.rpm

9. Documentation index.html file has inaccurate links

     The index file installed in /opt/cell/sdk/docs/index.html contains
     some inaccurate links. Here is a list of documents with inaccurate
     or missing links and where you can find them on your system:
